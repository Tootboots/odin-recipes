    <p>Pad Thai is one of the first dishes I learned to make that was a food no one had cooked for me at home before. 
        It was interesting trying different combinations and cooking methods to try and get that restaurant flavor, and I don't think I'm there yet but I've managed to make something that tastes delicious nonetheless.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>To make Pad Thai, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4oz Pad Thai dried rice sticks</li>
            <li>3 tbsp packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp tamarind puree</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 onion <em>(white or yellow)</em></li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves <em>finely chopped</em></li>
            <li>6 oz chicken breast <em>sliced</em></li>
            <li>2 eggs <em>lightly whisked</em></li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup of beansprouts</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chives or green onion, cut into 1" pieces</li>
            <li>1/4 cup peanuts <em>finely chopped</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Instructions</h3>
        </p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Place noodles in a large bowl and pour boiling water. Let soak for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse under cold water.</li>
            <li>Mix the Brown Sugar, Tamarind Puree, Fish Sauce, and Oyster Sauce in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large non-stick pan over high heat. Add garlic and onion to cook for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and cook for 2 minutes or until mostly done</li>
            <li>Push the contents of the pan to one side, and pour the whisked eggs into the other side. Scramble using a wooden spoon, adding oil if needed, then mix into chicken.</li>
            <li>Add bean sprouts, noodles, and then the sauce mixture.</li>
            <li>Toss gently for two minutes until the sauce is absorbed into the noodles.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic chives and then half of the peanuts. Toss quickly and then remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, sprinkled with the remaining peanuts. Add a spritz of lime juice, beansprouts, and chili flakes. Enjoy!</li>
